# rust_hls_examples

This repository contains examples of how to use rust_hls.

The examples are also used to test rust_hls.

There are two trivial modules, a adder and a multiplier. HLS is completly overkill for these examples, but they are easy to understand.

The third example uses these two modules to verify that multiple HLS modules can be used in the same project. If that third example compiles in a sandboxed environment with only a rust and a C compiler, then rust_hls is working.
