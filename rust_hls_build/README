# rust_hls_core

<!-- cargo-rdme start -->

This module provides functionality for processing crates with rust-hls annotations.
You probably do not want to use this directly, but instead use the `rust_hls`crate
or the `rust_hls_cli` crate (I am not yet sure which one as the project is constantly restructured).
