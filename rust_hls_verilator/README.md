# rust_hls_verilator

<!-- cargo-rdme start -->

Provides functionality for running verilator to generate verilated C++ code

This crate is part of the rust_hls project. Its wraps the functionality of the verilator binary and provides a rust interface to it.

## Example

```rust
use rust_hls_verilator::verilate_module;
let verilog = "
module test(input clk, input reset, output reg [7:0] out);
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            out <= 0;
        end else begin
            out <= out + 1;
        end
    end
endmodule
";

// Run verilator on the verilog snippet from above
let files = verilate_module(verilog, "test").unwrap();

// files will contain all C files that were generated by verilator
```

You can use the `verilate_module` function to generate verilated C++ code from a verilog module.

When compiling the generated C++ code you need to link against the verilated library.
You can use the `obtain_verilator_libs` function to copy the library files from a verilator installation.
